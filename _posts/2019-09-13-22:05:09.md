Mid-Autumn Day! Had OX tail for lunch :-)

2 FIBA semi-final games. The score of Spain and Australia were so close all
the way in their match, and the Spainish team won the game in the 2nd OT!

An Australia player, Andrew Bogut, throwed out impolite and offensive words to
the host country (China) and the referee team after the team lost the match. I
am not surprised because this man also said some irresponsible words to the
Chinese swimming player Sun Yan months ago. We welcome Australian friends and
the team, but he gets nothing but boos.

The game between France and Agentina was a hot spot, but it is surprisingly
one-sided. The Agentina team's defense strategy restricted the France team
fairly effectively, and finaly brought the whole team to an overwhelming win.
