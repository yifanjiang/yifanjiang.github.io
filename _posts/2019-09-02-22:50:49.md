Being a good listener in the morning interview.

Chinese basketball team lost the game to Poland by 73:76 in OT. It's an
exciting game but our team had terrible mistakes in the last seconds of
regular time. We led by 3 scores 10 seconds before the end of game, then the
consecutive side line passes were neatly broken and grabbed by Polish
team. That was abnormal and made everyone depressed.
