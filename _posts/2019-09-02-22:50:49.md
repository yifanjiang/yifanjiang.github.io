First day for kids going to school, traffic jam is felt. When I bypassed the
kindergarten near home, I heard children was crying loudly and perfectly
together - must the kids' first time to kindergarten :-)

Was a good listener in the morning interview.

Chinese basketball team lost the game to Poland by 73:76 in OT. It was an
exciting game but our team made terrible mistakes in the last seconds of
regular time. We led by 3 scores 10 seconds before the end of game, then the
consecutive side line passes were neatly broken and grabbed by Polish team -
leading to a discouraged OT. That was abnormal and made everyone depressed.
