After working from home in morning hours today, lunch was
alone in Hopson one, Donburi(大碗丼). 丼is a Japanese character
means bowl of rices with food on top. Chinese has a complicated
word called 盖饭. So the translation is 大碗盖饭. Love it!

Learnt from a Frederic that yesterday was his son's first day to
the school. The kid cried loudly in the morning when he left mom
and dad, but was very happy after the first day to school! Cute,
and how time flies! :-)

As for the breastroke after the breathing "optimization" for a
couple of days, I got a chance to correct a bit my kick today in
early evening. When my feets turn out, my habit was not to mind
the position of my ankles, toes and feet. This will less the
power of a push from kick. So trick is to keep the toes outward
to each side, which will naturally make feet a "V". The following
is a picuture from a wonderful
[tutorial](https://www.swimoutlet.com/guides/how-to-kick-breaststroke):

In the late evening, the Chinese basketball team lost Venuezula
by the score of 59:72. I am not quite familiar with basketball,
but a national team scored only 59 in a whole game sounds
abnormal. Then I had a quick review of the overall first round
score at http://www.fiba.basketball/basketballworldcup/2019/games
, not surprisingly only 4 out of the 40 games had a team which
scored less than 60. What a bummer!
