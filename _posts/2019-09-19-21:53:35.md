Had some intresting catch-up talks with T, one of my English teachers. I
introduced the football match to him and he was once a goal keeper. It
seems the British calls *playing as a goal keeper* as short as *playing
goal*. He shared what he saw about the parade rehersal near the SKP during
the mid-autumn days. And I realized why my way ahead home was blocked when
I was back from cinema in that day.

Had a content English class then in the afternoon with teach G:

* The question *do you see a glass half full or half empty?* figuratively means the attitude is optimistic or pessimistic
* Some negative expressions about a "false optimistic"
  * he sees the world through rose-coloured glasses
  * he lives in a dream
  * it's just pie in the sky
  * quote: *They are highly skeptical of Washington's promise that they will 'eat pie in the sky' solely from war orders, which they decry publicly.*
* when describing a people forever optimistic, use the adjective "eternal": *an eternal optimist"
* *hold true* is easily misused. It does not solidly mean something is
   positive, realistic or logically correct. Instead, it means what happend in
   the past still exists nowadays.  ** e.g. I was a pessimist, but now it does
   not hold true at all.
* *deep dark secret* is not a negative word, it's just a secret
* the correct verb for privacy is to *violate* somebody's privacy

When I asked a question about the hypen rules since G always told us it is
with hyphen or not when he introduce a new word combined with nouns, G said
it usually has no rules and the dictionaries do not have dominated rules
for that at all. The example given was "hardworking", "hard working" and
"hard-working", all of them could be right.

The interestingly part, which is easy to remember, is when you are not sure
and have no dictionaries around. The compound word usually needs a hyphen
when they are either *used as an adjective* or *used as a single meaning*.

What is *used as a single meaning*?

* full-time employee
  * *full employee* alone doesn't make sense
  * *time employee* alone doesn't make sense
* hard-working employee
  * *hard employee* alone doesn't make sense
  * *working employee* alone doesn't make sense
* four-wheel-drive vehicle
  * *four vehicle* alone doesn't make sense
  * *wheel vehicle* alone doesn't make sense
  * *drive vehicle* alone doesn't make sense

I definitely took quite some more notes in my notebook but I left the notes
in the office. I will have to review them.
