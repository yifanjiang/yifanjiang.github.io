Have first time hands-on practice on Jekyll/github, beautify the
page with the nice profile logo. Create several script to handle
index.md and _posts directory:

_creatediary.sh_: create a diary file in _posts, as well as append a new entry in index.md. The time stamp rules the namespace.

_deletediary.sh_: remove the _posts/$1 file, as well as the entry in index.md

_clean_index.sh_: merge consecutive blank lines, mostly produced by the deletediary.sh, into a solo empty line
