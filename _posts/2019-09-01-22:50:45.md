5 home-made (I-made) dishes for lunch, and we finished *all* of them cleanly!

In the afternoon, the last Sunday training for the China IFL
[2019 Autumn League](http://chinaifl.com/autumn-2019).

In the evening, had a quick talk with Wesley (Belgian), whose Chinese is probably better than his
English, knowing more about the IFL matches: 2 x 15 mins per match without stop, 2 matches per
Tuesday night consecutively! 

Wesley: "Each match, we run to death, then subtitute"
I said: "Holy ..."
He said "It is doable"

Really? Let's see.
