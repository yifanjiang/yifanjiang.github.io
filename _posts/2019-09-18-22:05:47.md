A nice lunch in You Jing Ge with current and former colleagues (friends), W,
G, B, S and me. Dishes were great and the catch-up was interesting. It was W's
treat and was appreciated.

One showed us a conversation with a teacher of the kid. The context was about
an assignment:

Ask: what else shall my kid bring tomorrow?
Teacher: nothing but his brain.

Is the person held this attitude actually qualified to educate our children?
