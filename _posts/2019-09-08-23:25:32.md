### Football

An good Sunday football game with another team in Jing Wu. It is not as
intense as a real match, but the 6 v 6 lasts 3 hours. The opponent is very
good at tactics, the consecutive spot passing and the how they take the pass
are impressive. I ran back and forth for both attacking and defencing until
exhausted at the end, and so does the opponent.
