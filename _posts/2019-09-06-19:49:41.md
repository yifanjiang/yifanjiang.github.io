### Breast Stroke

Concentrate on kick without counting the strokes/25m times. Feel much better
posture and rhythm today.

### Basketball

China VS South Korea today, good luck Chinese team!

### Hongkong

Most of us, Chinese living in mainland China, are fighting to build a better
country. So as I have seen in Beijing, majority really treat it as an
entertainment show. Some people like me felt a bit shame that they are wasting
time doing things violently and meaninglessly. Most importantly, the city's
infrastructure is innocent. Why do they break those stuff. Oh, being brainless
and crappy youth would be the answer.
