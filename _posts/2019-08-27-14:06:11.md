The morning interview was interesting, and I spent 2 hours on it talking about
everything including something the interviewee might have interests to look
into more in his spare time.

Lunch time was with my wife, we had sauerkraut fish in a new restaurant (*Tai
Er*, literally means *too two*, figuratively means *I am too stupid that I
only know how to make fish*). It was the best pickle and fish ever: selective
peppers, chillis and well preserved sauerkraut. The waiter told my wife that
when she asks for a service, she should raise her hand and make a gesture of
*victory* (means *two* I guess) :-)

Tomas Chvatal and Martin Pluska are in Beijing this week and we had some
interesting talk related with packaging and GNOME stuff. I learnt from Tomas
that osc is able to do some cross server submission and copypac actions using
"-A" and "-to" options. while "-to" is only available for copypac.

Besides, Tomas told me evolution-ews does not cooperate with opensuse mailing
list well when a gpg key is attached in a mail he sent. Consequently there are
always garbage characters appended in the last bit of the
[mail](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-08/msg00257.html).
