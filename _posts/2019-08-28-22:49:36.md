### Morning

Chewing emails, arranging interviews and partly joining Tomas and Martin's
session, in which I asked quite some questions like:

* What's the difference between ExclusiveArch and BuildArch?

  *Answer:* BuildArch is supposed to do the same while never use it unless noarch
  needs to be specified.

* Is `Supplement: $hardwares` used in real products?

  *Answer:* Yes, a demo was shown in xf86-video-xxx.

* Is there a "mirror version" of Requires as `Supplement` to `Recommend` or
  `Enhance` to `Suggests`?

  *Answer:* No.

### Lunch

Not interesting

### Afternoon

Continue to have fun of build service with Tomas and Martin. I have been
confused what `osc dependson` and `osc whatdependson` really do regarding the
build dependency, since they always show quite different result from what I
learnt from reading the raw spec file. I showed a demo to Tomas who concludes
the command is not reliable these days :-) The practice he has been using is
to download all the spec and analyze them statically when it is needed. 

### Joke

I heard a joke from Yang yesterday that she heard a conversion from two kids
on the street, a boy and a girl. And I still keep laughing today whenever
thought about it :-)

The boy fires:     I know what will be my kid's family name in the future but you do not.

The girl defenses: I always know my kid is really mine in the future but you do not.
