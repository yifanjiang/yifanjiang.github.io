Y suggested go to the cinema and see the movie Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs
& Shaw. So we went to watch it in the earlier afternoon. Good movie and much
better story telling than the last one. Action is still the main course. I
like those "sparks" between Hobbs and Shaw, the thought of technology, as
well as the "cold weapon" fight and the family gathering of the last battle at
the village in Samoa (Hobbs' hometown).

I said to Y that Samoa's plants and scenary in the film is quite similar with
what we experienced in Nadi, Fiji. Y told me they are geologically similar in
the middle of Pacific Ocean. It is absolutely right, as in the picuture, where
the green box outlines Fiji and the red is Samoa:
