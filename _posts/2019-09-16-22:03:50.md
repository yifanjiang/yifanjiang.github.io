### Work

Chew a bit what ostree really does in the context of flatpak, learning through
the verbose debug message from gnome-software --verbose and flatpak --verbose
--ostree-verbose.

It looks like gnome-software could do things correctly at most of time in
Tumbleweed. Despite that the progress bar seems not reflecting the run time
installation and makes people feel it always sticks to 0% when either the run
time is significantly large or the connection to the hub is terribly slow.

Checked a bit the strange "pcre not compiled with utf-8" issue in a
colleague's machine when launching GNOME, which ends up with a finding that a
self compiled pcre does not cater for the need of glib2. Thus gnome-session
crashes before bringing gnome-shell up.

Checked a bit a vncmanager issue on S390 (when vncserver works and the
counterpart stack on x86_64 works), not a complete clue.

### Breakstroke

Top 1 speed in the swimming pool today (less people now since the weather gets
colder). I am getting well used to the corrected kicking, stroking and body
position.
