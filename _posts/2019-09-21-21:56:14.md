A lazy weekend day.

Lunch was in a restaurant we just heard yesterday night. It made Chong Qing
hotpot taking frogs and fish heads as major ingredients. We did not order fish
heads since we already had the best in Xi'an. The taste was above average and
the frogs were really big. The service of the restaurant was done by Chong
Qing local aunties, who were very attentive, particularly in the aspect of
reminding the good timing to eat frogs and crsip pork.
